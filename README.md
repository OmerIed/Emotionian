# Emotionian
Emotionian is designed to completely change how we track and understand our mental health and emotional well-being. By utilizing a voice-activated diary system, it eliminates the need for manual mood tracking, providing a more natural and intuitive user experience. Our system distinguishes itself through the integration of automatic speech recognition (ASR), emotion recognition technologies, and a generative AI model (Gemini) that provides insights and recommendations for the user, offering a comprehensive analysis of both the tone and content of user entries, as well as insights about emotional patterns and more. This special approach allows for a nuanced understanding of emotional states over time, setting Emotionian apart from existing solutions that rely on simplistic mood inputs or predefined questions.
